## Ingredients
Serves: 30 - 35 pieces

- 2 cups rice
- 1.75 cups of jaggery
- 2 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds / yellu
- 1 tablespoons roasted poppy seeds / gasgase
- 0.5 cup of dry coconut
- 5 cardammom powdered
- 4 tablespoons / 20ml of water
- Oil for deep frying

## Method

### Pre-prep

- Wash the rice and soak in water for 3 days. 
- Water has to be changed everyday.
- On the day of making the recipe, drain the rice and spead it on a dry cloath to dry for 30 minutes.
- The soaked rice should not dry completely, it has to be little moist.
- Powder the rice not too course nor too fine. To a chiroti rave consistency.
- After wordering, cover it with a moist cloth to avoid drying. At all times, the rice has to be moist.

### Paaka - The most important

- Add the jaggery and the water to a pot and place it on a medium high flame.
- Let it come to a boil and bubble.
- To test if the paaka is ready, put a few drops of the paaka to a plate with some water in it. If the paaka flows when you title the plate, it needs more time. If the paaka almost solidify instantly and does not flow when tilted, ITS READY..!!
- Now you need to hurry, else everything can go for a toss in a minute.
- Reduce the flame the medium and toss in sesame, poppy, dry coconut and the cardommon. Mix well.
- Now slowly start adding the rice powder while contineously stirring to avoid lumps.
- Once all the rice powder has been added, cook it on a medium flame for 5 mins.
- The perfect paaka will be soft yet firm.

### Frying the kajjaya

- Let the paaka cool down for 20-30 minutes, hot enough to hande with bare hands.
- Keep the oil on medium high at all times.
- Take a lemon size portion of paaka and make it flat. Put it in the oil.
- Fry only one kajjaya at a time. Once the kajjaya starts to float, flip it over and the second one can be added into the oil.
- Once the kajjayya is tan brown, take it out of the oil and press it to release excess oil.
- Repeat the process by frying one by one.

## Tips

- Getting the paaka right is the most tedious here. Keep everything ready. Once the jaggery boild to right consistency you have to be quick, else everything can go downhill and the paaka can become too hard.
