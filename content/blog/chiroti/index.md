## Ingredients
Serves: 10 - 12

### For chiroti
- 1 cup chiroti rave / Fine semolina
- Oil / ghee to fry
- 3 tbsp ghee
- 2 tbsp fine rice flour
- Water

### To serve:
- Powdered Sugar + cardamom
- Badam Milk

## Method

- Add water one spoon at a time until a smooth firm dough is formed.
- Knead well for 5 minutes. 
- Set aside for 20 minutes with light oil on top of dough to avoid it getting dry.

## Saati and prep

- Whisk ghee in a bowl until it becomes smooth and light in color. 2-3 minutes.
- Add rice flour and continue whisking it until it becomes fluffy similar to whiped cream. The saati is now ready.
- Divide dough into equal parts and roll each one into a square or round shape.
- Spread the saati onto each of the rolled dough and stack them onto one another.
- Tightly roll is stack to a log, seal the edges and strech it with pulling the the log to get a long and consistent thick log.
- Divind the log into 1.5 inch parts.
- Take each part, flatten the edges first ensuring the saati does not ooze out when rolling.
- Roll the chiroties to 4-5mm thickness.

## Frying the chiroti

- Heat oil or ghee in a deep kadai on a medium low heat.
- Slide in the chiroti, with a laddle/soutu start pouring the hot oil onto the center of the chiroti. 
- Keep pouring the hot oil repeatedly onto the chiroti. This creates layers and makes the chiroti crisp.
- Flip and fry until the bubbles go away.
- Remove from oil and put them onto a tissue.

## Serving

- Take chiroti in a plate, sprinkle generously the powdered sugar.
- Crush it, pour badam milk on top of it and Enjoy!!
